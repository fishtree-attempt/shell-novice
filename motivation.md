	## Why do we learn to use the shell?

	The shell allows users to automate repetitive tasks and capture small data manipulation steps that are normally not recorded to make research reproducible 
</section>

<section class="slide">
	## The Problem

	- Running the same workflow on several samples can be unnecesarily labour intensive
	- Manual manipulation of data files is often not captured in documentation and causes analysis not to be reproducible
	- Because manual data manipulation steps are not captured, it is hard to troubleshoot or review

	## The Shell 

	- Workflows can be automated through the use of shell scripts
	- Built-in commands allow for easy data manipulation (e.g. sort, grep, etc.)
	- Every step can be captured in the shell script and allow reproducibility and easy troubleshooting
